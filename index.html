					<p id ="Hello">Hello!</p>
					<p>
						I'm currently a master's student at University of Washington in their Human-Centered Design
						& Engineering (HCDE) program. Before that I was at Universitty of California, Davis studying Design. <br><br>

						At Davis I was super fortunate to help commence the UC Placemaking Initiative under Glenda Drew and Brett Snyder
						and lucky to learn under Katia Vega in her Wearable Technology (now Interactive Objects) Lab. Both organizations have helped
						me realize two critical yet equally important perspectives on design. <br> <br>

						<span>_1. Technological </span> <br><br>

						<span>_2. Social </span> <br><br>

						Right now I'm pretty into rural computing and tangible-user interfaces. My design heroes beyond the professors
						who have inspired me are Hiroshi Ishii, John Maeda, Ash Thorpe, Ivan Poupyrev, Florian Aupetit, and Atey Ghailan.<br><br>

						I'm pretty good at using Adobe Creative suite applications, coding (R, Python Javascript), web development, and photography
						I wish I was better at illustrations, animations, bio-technology, and engineering. Always looking for innovative
						opportunities and challenging the current paradigm. <br><br>

						Let's tell stories.<br>
