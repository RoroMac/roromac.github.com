            Through the brainstorming process, I identified key qualities of 
            current technology, several relevant issues, and generated ideas on 
            how to remedy these problems through the previously identified traits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the broad nature of technology, I managed to distinguish three 
            primary uses; <span> &nbsp; measurement, simulation, and communication </span>&nbsp;. Measurement, 
            in a simple definition, is the recording of information. A more 
            complicated interpretation includes the storing of values, accuracy 
            and range of data, and the functions and calculations of modifying 
            information. The simulation of information involves the presentation, 
            through visuals or physical vibrations. And lastly, communication 
            is the application of technology as a virtual medium for those to 
            spread or gain information.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I only discussed a small sample 
            of issues, I thought that they had a wide enough variety so that I 
            could explore the possible applications of technology. These issues 
            as seen focused on <span>&nbsp;public policy awareness, opioid crisis, economic 
            disparity, and mental health </span>&nbsp;. In discussing these issues, I tried to 
            find several possible causes for why this occurs and how the previously 
            generated traits of technology could help generate possible ideas. 
            Of these ideas, I came up with a select few possible solutions which 
            I would like to research further. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Using <span>&nbsp;working from home </span>&nbsp;to help 
            bring jobs to underprivileged and at-risk communities. Could we create 
            jobs for people so that they don’t have to move away from their 
            communities? Could we create virtual economies that don’t require a 
            high degree of education? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Using <span>&nbsp;crowdsourcing </span>&nbsp;as a way to help 
            review grant writing and nonprofit proposals. Nonprofits could 
            upload their documentation onto a website and receive feedback 
            and edits so that they can perform better. Additionally, this 
            resource could be used by the general public for awareness of the 
            resources that they provide. 
        </p>        
        <p>
            Additionally, as an unexpected conversation 
            forum, I would like to propose a <span>&nbsp;virtual bus-stop </span>&nbsp;. 
            This would act similar to a google search engine however with each
            search, the users get transported to a chat forum with several random 
            members. These members are held there for an indeterminate amount of time 
            from 30-seconds to several minutes. Users are unnamed, random, and from 
            international audiences. Hopefully the shared space and anonymity could help 
            instigate conversations and experiences. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While I’m not too sure if any of 
            these ideas are worth implementing, I think that understanding the benefits 
            of technology could be explored across a multitude of scenarios.
