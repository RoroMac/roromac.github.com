        The internet is indisputably a large mechanism, with millions of webpages. Google is the most 

        widely-used program for indexing this information through relevant keywords. However, this essay 
        serves as a reference to explore how we find new ideas. Especially, how do we find relevant information, 
        tools, programs, or associations, especially if we don’t know the words? Do we rely on news articles, 
        forums, or help columns to pose our questions and hope that someone recommends a resource suited 
        for our needs?<br> <br>
            Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu, assesses the virtual economy that’s composed of 
        digital monopolies in his published 2012 Wall Street Journal article,“In the Grip of the New Monopolists; 
        Do away with Google? Break up Facebook? We can’t imagine life without them— and that’s the 
        problem”. He begins his article by assessing the cultural impact which these titans have and their claim 
        on basic functions. Users go to these companies because they’re simply the most convenient. “Google 
        ‘owns’ search; Facebook, social networking; eBay rules auctions….”(Wu). Wu makes a critical stance 
        when he claims that it’s not a bad thing that these information is dictated by these large corporations 
        and that it’s natural. Monopolies grow from technical superiority. However, their attempt to stay relevant 
        in transition periods of another company surpassing is when their user-base often faces troubles. 
        Additionally, he warns readers about the dangers of monopolies and their usual resistance to change 
        and lack of innovation.<br><br>
            Adrianne Jeffries is a writer and editor about articles intersecting between technology and 
        science. Her post “Once the biggest source of social traffic on the web, StumbleUpon fights to stay 
        relevant” on a digital news site, The Verge, talks about decline of one of the biggest social media 
        companies nearly a decade ago. StumbleUpon is a random website indexer. Users can click a button 
        and be directed to one of its many randomly suggested websites. Users can either like or dislike the 
        website and continue on their virtual journey with user-generated content. In 2009, StumbleUpon was 
        the most popular social media website with 25 million users and a button pushed roughly 1.2 million 
        times per month. To keep up with modern graphic styles and compete with other growing social media 
        apps, StumbleUpon redesigned their website in 2012. However, this redesign included features that 
        seemed unnecessary, didn’t work, and “seemed lonely” (Jeffries) in comparison to the discovery 
        websites like Reddit or Digg. Additionally, it seemed like StumbleUpon had an ineffective model for 
        advertisements. Jeffries makes a claim that while StumbleUpon (at the time) was a useful tool for finding 
        new information, it was effectively a diversion. Ultimately, it competed with any social media or 
        recreational activities. It appears that they weren’t able to fully compete after shutting down in 2018.

            To understand how people use the internet, I looked towards metaphors. Josh Dzieza, a 
        technology-interest writer at The Verge, writes about the cognitive importance these metaphors in “A 
        history of metaphors for the internet”. He makes a claim that metaphors have a way of humanizing and 
        understanding the very difficult concept of the internet. The cyberspace was coined as a method to 
        describe leaving your body and encountering a whole wide arrange of information. The information 
        highway was changed this idea to depict the internet as a space that takes users to wherever they want. 
        However, this connotation has also been used as an argument for government regulations to an 
        argument for virtual freedom. Could we apply the idea of metaphors for changing how we perceive 
        current search engines?
