            Without a doubt, Google has been one of the largest developments to 
            originate from the dotcom bubble. It has become a cultural icon for its ability to catalogue 
            virtual information in a manner so that anyone, regardless of demographic, can find anything. 
            A consequence for creating a tool meant for finding other objects is that people hardly pay 
            attention to the apparatus itself. This may be accredited to the very easy to use user interface. 
            However, in their many subdivisions it’s surprising to see how the user interface changes.

        <h3><a href="google.com">Google.com</a></h3>
        <p>
            Google search engine is its original function. It has the ability to take 
            in a couple of selected keywords to generate results it deems relevant to the users’ 
            search.<br><br>
            The main page is simple. “Google” is centered and colorful, 
            directing the users eye. A search bar underneath acts like an underline. 
            Beneath it are the two functions; “Google Search” which generates a list of 
            results and “I’m Feeling Lucky” which directs users to the most relevant result. The s
            implicity makes it easy. Users aren’t overwhelmed with a barrage of special effects and 
            distracting animations. The magnifying glass is used to further reinforce what users 
            can do with the bar and indicate it as an element that users can work with. 
            A microphone, is shown in a matching color palette to indicate an interactive
             element and an on-hover dropdown tells users that they can talk into the search bar 
             for further accessibility. <br><br>
            Located around the edges of the page are small words and icons. 
            These icons take you to other functions of google, but are often
             overlooked on the main page because of their miniscule presence. On 
             the right side are redirect links for products meant which users can use. 
             “Images” and “Gmail” are explicitly listed while the others are hidden behind a
              grid icon. The left side, are more informational links to show what Google can do.<br><br>
            After entering an item into the search bar, a 
            list of relevant information is shown. The top bar
             stays relatively similar between search results. The 
             Google icon in the top left corner redirects to the main page 
             (although often unnecessary to search again). The search bar is still 
             present so users can enter new vocabulary for another search. More specialized
              search tools are presented underneath the bar so that users can immediately select 
              what kind of information they want presented; gis, webpages, news, images, etc. The 
              information itself is typically presented in a vertical with webpages and a short description 
              where the term can be found. Google also predicts what kind of information the user wants by 
              including translations, definitions, questions asked about, and more. Searches related by Google 
              allows users to find more information without having to enter more keywords. There is an abundance 
              of whitespace used on both sides (more on the right), a lack of color (with the exception of included
              images), and very few variations to make the program easy to use. Google search also limits the 
              amount of information that users see per page to make it less overwhelming. An additional
               panel for relevant searches are placed above the page directory so that users can simply
                generate a new search with more specific terms than go to the next page.

        <h3><a href="About.Google">About.Google</a></h3>
        <p>
        The “About Google” page is surprisingly different and hard to navigate. 
        Users are greeted with a mission statement in large big letters that 
        match the Google color palette. Users can either scroll down or use a 
        hamburger navigation menu to find what they’re looking for. The main elements
         are divided into stories, commitment, and products. The main page also links 
         to company hiring and archived google doodles. The footer contains an even more 
         expansive list of options in categories ranging in press, company, terms of service, 
         and their non-profit work. The website uses blue to indicate interactive (clickable) areas. 
         The pictures are large, colorful, and in high quality. The contents of its page are separated 
         by a gracious amount of white space.<br><br>
        A Black History Month section is placed at the top for
         its relevance. Clicking it leads to a web page that appears to
          have been designed a little bit more thoughtfully. Images decorate 
          the background in relevance to the theme and an in-page navigation bar is used 
          at the top to redirect users to special topics. Additionally, a video is placed at 
          the very top to act as a prelude to the information below. This video doesn’t autoplay 
          and its duration is listed on top of it. The first section, history makers, integrates 
          scrolling through an animation. Based on its position, a name, description, and position
           come up based on its category. The phrase “the most searched...” is a clever way to integrate 
           their corporate identity as a search company. The rest of the webpage falls in line with its
            identity as it uses large font-sizes, images, and lots of white space. <br><br>
        Another web page of the site is their stories section where 
        it includes narratives of how people are using Google-Sponsored 
        technology to make impact. Halfway through, there is a video 
        that plays and surprises the users by changing the entire web page
         into dark mode to focus further on the video. Beneath that video,
          a scrolling line shows recently published videos. If a title catches 
          the users’ eye, they can put their mouse on the line to stop the moving 
          line and can click on that video. Another interesting interface is the use 
          of a grid that has a dropdown menu so that users can change what information 
          it provides. However, the interface is oddly very distinct from the rest of the
           webpage and does not integrate well. <br><br>
        The interesting thing about this website
         is how it very subtly redirects users into 
         other websites also owned by google. By going 
         into the Google commitments tab users can be redirected
          to Safety.Google, Sustainability.Google, or Ai.google. These websites 
          all look remarkably similar to them but there’s so many small different
           variations that it’s confusing and an eyesore to look at. My favorite atrocity 
           being the sustainability.google and yourplanyourplanet.sustainability.google 
           which disconnected from each other. And because these are all different websites, 
           users are confused by why the navigation changes for seemingly no reason between pages.<br><br>
        Granted that there are a lot of interesting user interface tools being used between web pages, 
        it’s hard to remember where they lie in the confusing Google hierarchy of information.

        <h3><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Music Lab</a></h3>
        <p>The chrome music lab is a Google experimental website that is
             nested deep within experiments.withgoogle.com. This series of
              thirteen different interactive animations allow users to learn more
            about music through helpful visuals. Icons are separated as a grid holding
            different welcoming and colorful visuals. Upon mouse hover, the title of the 
            exercise appear with an arrow to reinforce the let’s go idea. Beneath the grid, is an 
            explanation with the signature use of excessive white space and colors to indicate hyperlinks. 
            A navigation bar is featured at the top to direct to the experiments or the about section. 
            A link to Google is involved at the bottom (but not the google experiment page). 
            Two programs that I thought were very interesting were Kandinsky and Piano Roll. 
            Both create sounds through visuals, but in very distinct methods. <br> <br>
            Kandinsky is an empty white board. Users hold down the mouse 
            and drag it to create a mark which is then translated into a particular sound. 
            This experiment teaches children, Kandinsky’s philosophy of transitioning visuals into sounds. 
            However, there are only a couple of colors used and very few sound distinctions. 
            It is interesting though, that if you draw a circle then a face appears to make
             a more humanistic choir-sound. When the user presses play, the canvas is
              read as a musical note from left to right. Only two different colors are
            used in the piece and three color combinations can be determined. <br> <br>
            Another experiment that I enjoyed playing with was the
             piano roll. Common music pieces are played while a visual
            runs on screen. Musical notes are distinguished by color
            and at various heights. Users can choose which musical pieces
            they want to play and how the notes sound (piano, or electronic
            synthesizer). Another interesting thing about it, is how users can record
            a sound and listen to how Google autotunes it to match the pitch.

        <p>	A free font developed by a Swedish design firm Essen International 
            and nonprofit Solvatten. There isn’t too much in terms of interaction,
        but it implements a subtle but powerful story of reminding people that
        refugees are people too. It is a nice and well-designed sans-serif font.
        It also proposes a question of if implemented with the services of
        Google could it help promote good behavior or could it be seen as
        limitation of free speech and met with criticism. Additionally, this 
        font can only seem to recognize three types of spellings Refugee, refugee, 
       and REFUGEE. Any other combination of capitals and lower-case letters are undetected.
